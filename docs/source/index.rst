Skookum JS
==========

Skookum JS, or `sjs` for short, is a JavaScript runtime built on top of the `Duktape <http://duktape.org>`_ engine.
It provides a simple way to write applications using JavaScript with a traditional synchronous I/O model. It tries
to minimize abstractions and give the developer as much control as possible over the platform and low level APIs.
