Thinking about contributing to Skookum JS? That's awesome, thanks!

Before you being to write any code, here are some simple guidelines which will save
us some trouble down the road.

* If you are fixing a small bug, just open a Pull Request
* If you are adding a new feature or fixing a reasonably big bug, please open an issue
first so we can discuss it beforehand
* Style fix patches are not welcome, you like your style and I like mine
* Make your code style look like mine
* Any new feature should come accompanied by documentation and tests

Once again, thanks for taking the time to contribute!
